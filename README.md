### Setup for `count_all_seqs.py`

1. Fork the repository at https://github.com/pvanheus/counting_sequences and clone a copy of the forked repository with:
````
    git clone <your forked repository URL>
````    
  Where <your forked repository URL> should be the *https* URL of your forked repository.

2. Put your module `seq_utils.py` in the lib/ directory.

3. Put your script `count_all_seqs.py` in the bin/ directory.

4. Edit env.sh to set CS_DIR to the correct value. You can then enable these settings by doing:

````bash
source env.sh
````

5. Commit your changes and push to GitHub. 

6. Email the location of your GitHub repository to Peter at *pvh@sanbi.ac.za* with the subject line "CSREPO: &lt;your forked repository URL&gt;".
